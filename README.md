## Project Overview
This repository contains a **data‑driven analysis** of **NFL offensive trends** from the **2023‑2024 seasons** with the goal of **predicting player performance for the 2025 fantasy football season**.  
Instead of focusing on individual talent alone, we examine **team‑level offensive environments**—play‑calling tendencies, efficiency, and fantasy point production—to give you a **data‑driven edge** for your fantasy drafts.

- **Full analysis:** Jupyter Notebook (`Fantasy_Team_Trends.ipynb`)  
- **Medium article:** *Using Data Science to Predict NFL Offensive Trends for Fantasy Football* (link in the notebook)
